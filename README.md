Big data parser for not-criminalized sorts of counter-security research

Turns out I need a "legacy account" to handle big data without the low rate limit. If you have a legacy account and would like to share it,
please reach out! This rate limit is making the program too slow for practical results.

Feel free to add any user/group IDs to the watchlist :3
